# Multi-biome evaluation of an improved model of photosynthesis

The aim of this repository is to compare the photosynthesis models of Johnson and Berry (2021) and Farquhar et al. (1980). 
Johnson and Berry (2021) proposed an improved formulation for the electron transport rate based on the functioning of the cytochrome b6f complex. It was proposed to replace the empirical equation in the Farquhar et al. (1980) model. Here, we evaluate the consequences of changing equations for the simulation of photosynthesis, we compare the model fits with gas exchange observations, and we propose solutions for the replacement of the traditional Farquhar et al. (1980) equations for use in vegetation models. This includes a solution to couple Johnson and Berry (2021) equations with a stomatal conductance model, and analytical solutions to adapt the existing extensive parameterization of leaf photosynthetic parameters for the Johnson and Berry (2021) model.


We used 5 main steps to perform the comparison and evaluation of the models:
- “1_ACi_comparisons_FvCB_JB_models.R” simulates and compare photosynthesis response curves to CO2 (A-Ci curves) with both models.
- “2_Fitting_ACi_curves_FvCB_JB_models.R” is used to fit previously published A-Ci curves and compare the predicted maximum potential electron transport rate by both models. 
- “3_AQ_comparisons_FvCB_JB_models.R” simulates and compare photosynthesis response curves to light (AQ curves).
- “4_Fitting_AQ_curves_FvCB_JB_models.R” is used to fit previously published A-Q curves.
- “5_Comparison_FvCB_JB_error.R” is used to compare the goodness of fit of A-Q curves.

The Johnson and Berry (2021) and Farquhar et al. (2021) model codes are located in the folder “R models” which also includes other R functions used for this analysis.
Data generated by the steps 1 to 5 are present in the folder “Outputs”. It includes the A-Ci and A-Q fits.
Figures generated by the steps 1 to 5 are located in the folder “Figures”.
